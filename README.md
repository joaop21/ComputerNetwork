# ComputerNetwork
Computer Network projects using CORE and Wireshark.

This project was carried out in the first semester of the third year of computer engineering at University of Minho. [2018-2019]

The main purpose of these 4 small projects was to learn and work on the network layer and the link layer, referring to the OSI model.

This project was developed by me and my colleagues, respectively:
